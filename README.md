# Professional Readme Generator

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)  

## Description
This was a project where I used node, inquirer, a switch statement, template literals, and the writeFile function from FS. Using these tools let me get a better understanding of them, and in the process I created a functional readme generator that will be useful to me in further projects. The generator will give you the option of 3 different licenses that will append the badge to the top of the README, but the program assumes you will also have a license section regardless. Clicking on the elements of the Table of Contents will take you to that area. Overall, the program takes in data from the user and puts it in the Markdown syntax  and creates a README file with that data in it.

## Installation
To use this program simply run "node index.js" while in the integrated terminal (from the index.js folder). Input the data for your readme and it will be outputted to a folder called "Output" within the Develop folder.

## Usage
This project could be used to create any README, as long as it follows the general guidelines of what a README is.

## License
Refer to the [License file](LICENSE).

## Credits
I used the mini project from the SMU folders and other instructional lessons, relating to the things like switch statements and how to use the prompt and write to file functions. My dad helped me with outputting the file and creating the directory if it didn't exist since I was having trouble with that part. 

## Tests
If you would like to run tests feel free to run the program using the installation instructions and then test it.
